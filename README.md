# About

I'm a Marie Curie research fellow in the department of geography at [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie). My work focuses on public participation in climate adaptation, specifically, the use of "serious games", geodata, maps, and open urban data to inform and facilitate public participation.

I also work on [computational geometry algorithms in Rust](https://github.com/georust/geo), and I have a longstanding interest in [geographic data processing and visualisation](https://github.com/urschrei/Geopython) in Python.

If you're interested, you can see my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=usNnd3IAAAAJ&hl=en). I almost never talk about work on [social media](https://mastodon.social/@urschrei).
